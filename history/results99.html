<FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Hillcroft were 3-0 down by the end of
the first quarter but they dug in and started to dominate all the phases
of the game. Dogged, careful defence meant Kenton's feeding passes couldn't
find their target men and it was always Hillcroft who seemed to come up
with the ground ball. Only heroic efforts by Simon Savage in the Kenton
goal preserved the visitors lead. A goal at the end of the 3rd improved
matters a little and&nbsp; Kenton were ahead by 6-4 at the start of the
4th. Kenton scored early on&nbsp; and then held on for 10 minutes whilst
Hillcroft laid seige to Simon Savage's goal. Desparate measures in the
closing minutes left Hillcroft open to the counter attack and Kenton were
able to stretch the lead to 9-4. Hillcroft scored with 45 seconds left
but Kenton responded straight from the next face to take the game 10-5,
a margin which flattered them.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold"></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Hillcroft arrived with&nbsp; a strong
squad, and as the game got underway, with the threat of rain sweeping across
the hills, it felt like a good match up.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Hillcroft struck the first blow,
with the attack forcing a long slide, dumping and finishing cleanly.&nbsp;
Hitchin fought back with a good period of possession and backed up shots.&nbsp;
Both teams fought hard and were evenly matched in most respects.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only area where one side had a significant advantage over the other
was at the face where the bulk of possession was in Hitchin's favor.&nbsp;
At quarter time the score was 3-3, at half time it was 5-5.&nbsp; It couldn't
have got any closer, but Hitchin were always playing catch up.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Clearly however the Hillcroft half
time team talk had an effect as they took good advantage of a couple of
fast breaks, and worked well in settled attack to put&nbsp; the Hitchin
defence under constant pressure. Hillcroft piled on four straight goals
to lead 5-9. Hitchin spirits were clearly low, but no one was going to
give up.&nbsp; Steadily Hitchin&nbsp; got a grip on the game once more
and replied with three straight goals to bring it up to 8-9 at three quarter
time.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The final quarter was high tension,
drama and passion.&nbsp; Hitchin were penalised and before the minute could
run down, Hillcroft fed, shot and led 8-10. Hitchin pulled back two goals
, and then it was 10 each with about 2 minutes remaining.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Hillcroft came up with the ball from
the face and moved the ball around the Hitchin cage.&nbsp; Two shots went
in, both with defensive sticks just diverting them.&nbsp; In the dying
moments Hitchin cleared, moved the ball cleanly up against a Hillcroft
defence still trying to organise itself.&nbsp; A shot, hit the keepers
chest, a second hit his foot.&nbsp; Davey Leach scooped the ball clean
from the scrum of players by the crease and slotted home with 10 seconds
left on the clock and the final whistle sent the Hitchin squad in to shouts
of joy.</FONT>

for lacrosse on Kenton's dinky sloping upper pitch but at least the necessity
for scuba gear did not arise (as it would have on the usual site). Kenton's
usual cutting game with feeds from behind the goal is well suited to a
small pitch and the home side were soon 3-0 up. Hillcroft pulled one back
by the end of the first quarter and rallied strongly in the second , dominating
possession and scoring 4 unanswered goals before Chase Tydings last-minute
effort bought the half time score to 4-5. It stayed close in the 3rd as
Kenton took a 9-8 lead. Two goals in 11 minutes gave Kenton had a 3-goal
lead as the game entered its last minutes. Hillcroft had to press Kenton's
ball carriers and this meant taking risks. Kenton skillfully kept possession
and exploited the openings offered by Hillcroft's death or glory approach
to open up a 5-goal lead by the final whistle.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hillcroft went into the 2nd quarter 6-0 ahead. But, make no mistake, Beckenham

it until decent scoring opportunities emerged. Hillcroft built a two goal
lead by the end of the 3rd quarter and scored again at the start of the
4th to make the game look safe but Bath never know they're beaten, twice
bringing the margin down to 2 goals as Hillcroft played keep - ball for
the last 10 minutes until a failed double-team attempt left Neil Catto
unmarked in front of goal for Hillcroft's final goal with 30 seconds on
the clock.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Hillcroft used 3 new players for their
first game of the season, 2 of whom met their team mates for the first
time on match day. It wasn't surprising that a side which looked good on
paper showed little cohesion during this victory over Beckenham.&nbsp;
Simon Whitehead (lately of Timperley), Neil Catto (Old Stops) and Takahiro
Watanabe (Nihon Uni, Japan) all look like useful additions to the HIllcroft
roster. Returnee Alex Rastelli made a useful&nbsp; contribution in goal.</FONT>
