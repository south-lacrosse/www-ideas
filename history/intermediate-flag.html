<h2>Intermediate Flag</h2>
<p>The Intermediate Flag was introduced in 1913, being the third Flag competition to be instituted
    by the Southern Association. The original 'Challenge Flag' (introduced in 1884) became the
    'Senior Flag' upon the introduction of the Junior Flag in 1890 this new tournament was required
    due to the expansion of the game during the 1880s.</p>
<p>In 1912 the Association decided to change the format of the flag competitions from the
    traditional knock-out system to a 'play-off' series between the top four sides following a
    'league style' competition. Due to the forty teams involved it was necessary to have a third
    grade of competition.</p>
<p>The first final was played at Lords Cricket Ground - in those days the venue of Flag Finals,
    county matches end many other important lacrosse games. Blackheath beat Lee II by 9-7 after
    extra time. This win was somewhat appropriate as Blackheath under their original name of London
    (the name was changed in 1888) had won the first Challenge Flag competition final in 1884.</p>
