<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Hitchin had this in the bag by half-time
when they led 7-1. A spirited recovery by the students saw honours even
for the second half and must leave them wondering what might have been
if they could have started that well. Hitchin "a" had a number of wily
senior players ready&nbsp; &amp; able to slow the game and control it so
that whilst Bath Uni had Hitchin beaten for legs &amp; lungs, smarts and
6 goals from Glen Lancaster won the day.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>This was a truly enthralling game to
watch. Hampstead like to make lots of chances and take them all and win
because they have scored most goals ( never mind how many they have let
in), whilst Kenton will hold the ball jealously with the intent of winning
because they have never let the other guys have the ball let alone score
(when the "other guys" do get the ball, they have to beat Simon Savage,
the South's finest goalie). Neither team's usual approach was going to
work. Hampstead couldn't afford to take chances which weren't certaintities
and Kenton couldn't afford to wait for mistakes. In the end,&nbsp; trailing
by 2 with 3 minutes to go, Hampstead drew their inspiration from Kipling
and "kept (their) head whilst all around were losing theirs". Phil Collier
drove from behind for the first goal and Simon Tarpey equalised with 87
seconds on the clock. Hampstead won the ball from the face and set up an
isolation for Lynyak. He drove, he shot, he scored and Hampstead were in
the lead for the first time in the game with 27 seconds on the clock. They
made no mistakes from the final face off and won the game. Hampstead's
defence kept them in the game as did Bernie Daniels in goal - cometh the
hour, cometh the man.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>This is a new tournament for the top
4 teams in the premiership. It was played out on a knockout basis over
four forty minute games as a show case event at the&nbsp; Clubs and Colleges
tournament for women's lacrosse. It may be a rude surprise to see a bunch
of blokes knock seven bells out of each other when what you expected to
see was the (rather more refined) ladies game but we were made to feel
pretty welcome. Purley showed up loaded for bear and easily disposed of
Hillcroft (who are still only shooting blanks) in the first semi.&nbsp;
Hampstead against Kenton was a closer affair with Kenton equalising from
6-2 down in the last quarter before Hampstead made the game safe with 2
quick goals. The final took a quarter to get going but then Purley found
their way through rather more often than Hampstead to run out winners 10-4.
Kenton beat Hillcroft for third place. All in all, a successful debut for
a new competition and a valuable chance to show the Men's game to a new
audience (several boyfriends of lady players expressed a desire to quit
rugby and play a game where you get to hit people with sticks).</FONT></FONT>

sure of a place in the Final Four tournament on the 28th with this comprehensive
defeat of a brave Tatsfield side. Goalie Steve Flint scored in a textbook
(apart from the absence of a single attack player) quick break goal to
add his name to the "hillcroft goal of the season" nominations for a second

in the absence of any more usual keeper. He tells me he had quite a good
game. He was unable (or unwilling) to name a team mate of whom the same
could be said. Hampstead were at their best - they can play a tough close
game but they also love to show off when the occasion arises and today
offered an ideal opportunity. Lets hope the crowds leaving the rugby game

<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hillcroft defence did about as
much as any defence has done against Purley (Purley have only twice conceded
fewer goals and on both occasions they let in 9). The trouble was at the
other end of the field where Hillcroft's short sticks ran an offence straight
out of the Bill Clinton playbook (everything but penetration). Purley were
always as good as they needed to be although it can't be said that they
were given much of an occasion to rise to through a combination of lacklustre
opposition and a greasy pitch.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>It took the students 70 minutes to
find their feet in this game. By that time, Hillcroft had shown them a
clean pair of heels and taken a 16 - 1 lead thanks largely to Paul Ford's
8 goal haul. London are an enthusiastic team and there is great potential
to be realised if they can turn out the same people on a regular basis.
The London lacrosse scene probably the most cosmopolitan in the world and
everybody likes to see new faces. London have a number of newcomers including
a defenceman with a busy, persistent style and quick hands called Toshihiro
Nakamura. He's from Kyoto and he's the first Japanese player ever to play
for an English club.</FONT></FONT>

last 40 seconds of this game. It's just as well for Kenton that the other
79 minutes saw the Hillcroft offence fail to take almost every chance it
was given. It still took Simon Savage who had a great game in goal for
Kenton to save this game for the visitors and keep Kenton's challenge for
the premiership alive for one more week.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Oxford Uni will be a side to watch

going on at Hitchin, hopefully a temporary blip.</FONT></FONT>

chaotic start to the season and show the rest of South lacrosse exactly
how good they still are - which is pretty good on their day. Don't bet
against them to win the flags and the final four in this form.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Bath rather rode their luck in this&nbsp;
game, Hillcroft played better lacrosse most of the time and their ridig
game denied Bath any opportunity to establish a settled attack. Hillcroft
were unable to turn their advantage into goals, mostly due to excellent
keeping from Bossisto the Bath goalie. A bizarre own goal by Hillcroft
and a disallowed 4th quarter goal completed the fortunate breaks for Bath
and ensured that they ran out winners.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>When it worked at all, Hillcroft's
game plan was too much for Croydon. Fortunately for Hillcroft, things only
started going wonky after a 9-2 lead had been established. Croydon dominated
the 3rd quarter for all but the last 2 minutes, taking the score to 9-5
before Hillcroft responded with 3 quick goals to restore their lead. Croydon
gave the 4th quarter everything but a resolute Hillcroft defence limited
them to 2 goals which was just as well because the attack seemed to have
downed tools for the day.</FONT></FONT>

this game only turning out 10 players. That being said, no side has looked
like getting near to Purley in League competition this season and, plainly,
Bath are now a side to be reckoned with. The game was close with Bath in
the lead for most of it until Purley called a time out with 5 minutes to
play in the final quarter and Bath ahead by one (8-7). Bath's new signing,
an attack player from Rice University, Houston Tx, scored 3 goals without
reply to make the game safe for the visitors.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Bath would seem to have found a couple
of useful recruits in Anthony Bossisto (an australian) and Steve Palmer
(from the US). Bossisto is a goalie and played "like a brick wall" to quote
local sage Jon Harrop as the Somerset side claimed their first victory
of the season over premiership opposition. This result makes the contest
for second in the premiership a very close affair and it's anybody's guess
which 3 teams will join Purley in the Final Four tournament.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Hampstead were unable to duplicate
the heroics of last weeks flag semi final in what should have been a dress

goal and from Steve Gaffney in midfield were good enough to see off a lacklustre
Hampstead side.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Hillcroft shrugged off a horrendous
injury problem and the difficulties presented by London Underground cancelling
all trains to Buckhurst and replacing them with buses to overwhelm a brave
Buckhurst Hill side. Ray Nash played his annual "get- the-club-out-of-trouble"
game and this year he scored in the opposition goal thereby going one better
than last season's outing at Bath ( he also managed 2 assists).</FONT></FONT>

This was a day when nothing went right for the South London side, nothing
worked, the posts got peppered, balls got dropped and so on. At the other
end, Kenton made their own luck with slick passing and well-timed cuts.
The score suggests Hillcroft were outclassed but it wasn't quite like that
and the final meeting between these teams (at Hillcroft) could be a great
game.</FONT></FONT>

Hampstead closed the scoring and ran out winners by 12 to 6. Great thinge

<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Canadians, Americans and Australians
gave a cosmopolitan feel to this game as a pugnacious Hitchin side gave
all to deny Hillcroft victory in a passionately fought encounter. Hitchin
opened the scoring through Mark Freemon in the closing minutes of the first
quarter but Tim Pritchard equalized for Hillcroft direct from the restart.
The home side took a two goal lead in the second quarter but, again, Hitchin
reorganized and the game was tied by half-time. Numerous penalties and
frayed nerves cost Hitchin in the 3rd and Hillcroft were able to take a
two goal lead. A steady keep-the-ball approach seemed to be working and
Hitchin went goalless for 10 minutes before Sheie scored. With 4 minutes
to go, Dave Leach found the net after a drive round the post gave him a
foot of room in which to shoot. Now it was Hillcroft's turn to give it
everything and a hard hitting, determined offensive unit saw to it that
every dropped ball was won and every clear was broken. Again and again
a shot went in, again and again Tsoupelis saved, again and again Hillcroft
won the ball back, until, in the dying seconds, the ball fell to the floor
inside the Hitchin crease. Eddie Thompson launched himself headlong at
it and flicked the ball into goal. Pandemonium broke out and it was some
time until the referee's ruling was known - no goal, Thompson had landed
in the crease before the ball went in. A tie was a just conclusion to a
memorable game which left everyone with lots to talk about.</FONT></FONT>

out the previously rampant Dark Blue attack whilst themselves scoring 3.

to play lacrosse in the third quarter, their passes started to find the

Hillcroft to 3 goals including a spectacular solo effort from defender
Mark Ashford, as the quarter closed with Bath 14-5 down. The 4th quarter
saw a the Hillcroft Midfield stop running and the defence stop concentrating
as Bath netted 6 more to Hillcroft's 3 The high note for the visitors in
this otherwise abysmal quarter came when 16 year old Ben Radford scored
his first goal for Hillcroft in premiership lacrosse. Hillcroft have some
