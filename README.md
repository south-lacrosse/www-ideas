# WWW Ideas

The repository holds code and ideas that may be useful in the future for the South Lacrosse website, but doesn't really belong in the main repositories.

This includes:

* Code which was used on the original version of the website and isn't used now, but we don't want to lose it as it may be used in the future.
* Ideas for database tables for handling submitting results through the website etc.
* PHP code from rejected prototypes which may be useful in the future
